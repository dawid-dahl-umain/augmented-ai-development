### The Problem: Two Common Approaches (Both Flawed)

Most developers using AI assistants fall into one of these patterns:

**Scenario 1: "Just Let the AI Do It"**

Using AI heavily without structure:

- Copy-paste suggestions without verification
- Ship code you don't fully understand
- Discover bugs in production
- No confidence that refactoring won't break things

**Result**: Fast but dangerous. Quality suffers.

**Scenario 2: "I'll Do It All Myself"**

Avoiding AI due to quality concerns:

- Slow manual implementation
- Missing productivity gains

**Result**: Safe but slow. You miss AI's benefits.

**The question**: Can you get AI's speed AND maintain quality?

**The answer**: Yes. That's what `AAID` provides.

### What DORA Research Shows

[DORA](https://dora.dev/) (Google Cloud's DevOps Research and Assessment) found that:

- 📉 **25% increase in AI adoption** = **7.2% drop in delivery stability**
- ⚠️ **39% of developers** report little to no trust in AI-generated code
- ✅ **Developer-owned testing** = proven driver of performance

### The AAID Solution

**AUGMENTED AI DEVELOPMENT (AAID)** combines:

1. **AI generation** (speed)
2. **TDD discipline** (quality)
3. **Mandatory reviews** (understanding)
4. **Acceptance testing** (business verification)\*

Result: **Speed AND stability** together, not a trade-off.

_\* The core daily cycle uses 1-3. Item 4 verifies business requirements; covered in Level 5._

**You're not being replaced. You're being augmented.**

### "But What If It's Not For Me?"

Learning a new workflow feels like commitment. Here's the good news:

**AAID is flexible:**

- Start with just the two developer mindset (will be presented in [Level 1](./1.md))
- Then start to use the planning and context stages, without yet diving into the TDD cycles
- Then add the agentic review checkpoints (bare minimum)
- Now, add TDD gradually as you get comfortable
- Initially, use it for new features only, not existing code

**AAID scales with your needs.** After 2-3 features, you'll probably find the workflow feels natural and actually speeds you up. If it doesn't fit your style after an honest try, you'll still understand TDD better; a valuable skill regardless.

> After you start to feel comfortable, start adding more advanced AAID skills, like Acceptance Testing.

**🛑 Checkpoint**: Does this resonate?

- **Yes** → Continue to [Level 1](./1.md) for the developer mindset
- **Show me first** → Jump to [Level 5](./5.md) to see TDD catch AI mistakes
- **Not convinced** → Review the DORA research above, or bookmark for later
