> 📷 **[Image Generation Prompt]**: Create a clean vertical workflow diagram showing 4 connected stages. Stage 1 (top): A stack of documents and code files representing "Context". Stage 2: Two people (developer and AI hologram) collaborating over a planning board with sticky notes. Stage 3: A single test file appearing with "it.skip" markers. Stage 4 (largest): A circular cycle showing three connected phases - a red traffic light for RED phase, green traffic light for GREEN phase, and a cleaning brush icon for REFACTOR phase, with small pause symbols (⏸️) between each. Arrows should flow downward through stages 1-3, then loop within stage 4. Use a clean, professional graphic style with a light background and tech-blue accent colors. The overall mood should convey systematic progression and controlled iteration.

AAID follows a **4-stage workflow**. Here's the big picture:

### The Four Stages

```
📚 Stage 1: CONTEXT PROVIDING
   → Give AI comprehensive project understanding

🤝 Stage 2: PLANNING
   → Collaborate on high-level approach and test roadmap

📝 Stage 3: TDD DEVELOPMENT STARTS
   → Decide how to start with the very first test

🔄 Stage 4: THE TDD CYCLE
   → Disciplined Red → Green → Refactor with mandatory reviews
```

### Quick Overview of Each Stage

**Stage 1: Context Providing**

- You provide: project docs, specs, relevant code
- AI understands: architecture, patterns, what you're building

**Stage 2: Planning**

- You and AI discuss the feature at a high level
- Create a planning roadmap (make sure you and the AI are aligned)
- **Critical**: Planning sets the destination; TDD finds the path

**Stage 3: TDD Development Starts**

- Choose: Test List approach or Single Test approach
- Create test structure (no test implementation yet!)

**Stage 4: The TDD Cycle**

- 🔴 **RED**: Write minimal failing test → ⏸️ Review
- 🟢 **GREEN**: Write simplest passing code → ⏸️ Review
- 🧼 **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality → ⏸️ Review
- Repeat for each test

### The Three Laws of TDD (Robert C. Martin)

The cycle enforces these fundamental principles:

1. **Write no production code without a failing test**
2. **Write only enough test code to fail**
3. **Write only enough production code to pass**

This discipline ensures every line of code exists because a test demanded it. No dead code. No untested logic.

**🛑 Checkpoint**: Can you visualize the workflow?

- **Yes, I see how it works** → Continue to [Level 4](./4.md) to see TDD catch real AI mistakes
- **This looks complicated** → That's normal! [Level 4](./4.md) shows a real example that makes it click

> 🎯 **You're doing great!** Don't worry about memorizing all the phases. After 2-3 features, the RED → GREEN → REFACTOR rhythm becomes as natural as git add → commit → push.
