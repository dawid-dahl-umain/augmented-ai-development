Before seeing AAID in action, let's demystify what it actually is. Spoiler: **there's no magic**. AAID is just two simple things:

### 1. A Rules File (Instructions for Your AI)

AAID is a markdown file containing instructions that teach your AI assistant to follow TDD discipline. Here's a tiny peek:

```markdown
## TDD Cycle Phases

### üî¥ RED Phase - Write Failing Test

**Core Principle:** Write only enough test code to fail
**On Success:** Present test and result, then STOP AND AWAIT USER REVIEW

### üü¢ GREEN Phase - Make Test Pass

**Core Principle:** Write only enough production code to make the test pass
**On Success:** Present implementation, then STOP AND AWAIT USER REVIEW

### üßº REFACTOR Phase - Improve Code Quality

**Core Principle:** Improve code structure with passing tests as safety net
**On Success:** Present outcome, then STOP AND AWAIT USER REVIEW
```

That's the essence. The file contains detailed instructions for each stage and phase, but it's just structured text guiding the AI's behavior.

**Where does it go?**

- Cursor: `.cursor/rules/aaid.mdc`
- Claude Code: `CLAUDE.md` in project root
- Other tools: Similar pattern

### 2. Optional Commands (Shortcuts to Speed You Up)

Instead of typing long requests repeatedly, you can create shortcuts. For example:

**Instead of typing:**

> "How does authentication work in this codebase? Show me the patterns we use, find similar examples, check what testing approaches we have, and report back without changing anything."

**You can simply type:**

```
/research-&-stop auth
```

The AI will explore authentication patterns in your codebase, search relevant documentation, and summarize findings‚Äîsaving you from typing the full request every time you need to explore something.

**Other useful shortcuts:**

- `/ai-roadmap-template` - Creates a test planning document for a feature
- `/project-context` - Establishes comprehensive project understanding

These commands are just pre-written prompts stored as markdown files. They're completely optional‚Äîyou can type everything manually if you prefer.

### Why This Matters

**Speed:**

- Commands save you from typing repetitive requests
- Rules keep the AI on track without constant reminders
- You spend less time instructing, more time building

**Simple and transparent:**

- No proprietary tooling or black boxes
- Just markdown files you can read, edit, and version control
- Works with any AI tool that supports custom instructions (Cursor, Claude Code, ChatGPT, etc.)
