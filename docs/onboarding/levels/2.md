![How AAID Actually Works](../../../assets/onboarding/2.webp)

Let's demystify what AAID actually is. **There's no magic**: just two simple things.

### 1. A Rules File (Instructions for Your AI)

`AAID` is a markdown file containing [instructions](../../../rules/aaid/aaid-development-rules.mdc) that teach your AI assistant TDD discipline. Here's the core structure:

```markdown
## TDD Cycle Phases

### 🔴 RED Phase - Write Failing Test

**Core Principle:** Write only enough test code to fail
**On Success:** Present test and result, then STOP AND AWAIT USER REVIEW

### 🟢 GREEN Phase - Make Test Pass

**Core Principle:** Write only enough production code to make the test pass
**On Success:** Present implementation, then STOP AND AWAIT USER REVIEW

### 🧼 REFACTOR Phase - Improve Code Quality

**Core Principle:** Improve code structure with passing tests as safety net
**On Success:** Present outcome, then STOP AND AWAIT USER REVIEW
```

That's it. The file guides AI behavior with structured text: what to do in each phase, when to stop for review. **No installation, no dependencies**, just markdown.

The file goes in `.cursor/rules/aaid.mdc` (Cursor), `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code), or similar for other AI tools.

### 2. Reusable Prompts (Custom Slash Commands)

Instead of typing long requests repeatedly, create reusable prompts. For example:

**Long version:**

> "How does authentication work in this codebase? Show me the patterns we use, find similar examples, check what testing approaches we have, and report back without changing anything. Check
> the web if you need more documentation!"

**Reusable prompt:**

```
/research-&-stop auth
```

The AI explores authentication patterns, searches docs, and summarizes findings.

**Other useful custom commands:**

- `/ai-roadmap-template` - Creates test planning document
- `/project-context [files]` - Establishes project understanding

Commands are pre-written prompts stored as markdown files. Completely optional (you can type everything manually if you want).

> More reusable prompts: [Appendix B](../../../appendices/appendix-b/reusable-prompts.md)

**Why this works:** Rules keep AI on track without constant reminders. Commands save typing. Everything is transparent markdown you can read, edit, and version control. Works with any AI tool supporting custom instructions (Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, etc.).

### Quick TDD Primer (If You're Fairly New to Testing)

AAID uses a development method called TDD. Here's the 30-second version:

**What's a test?** Code that automatically checks if your code works (instead of manual testing).

**What's TDD?** Write the test FIRST (before the feature exists), watch the test fail, then write just enough code to make it pass. With the passing test as a safety net, you can then safely work to improve the code.

**The three phases:**

- **🔴 RED**: Write a test for something that doesn't exist yet (it fails)
- **🟢 GREEN**: Write the simplest code to make it pass
- **🧼 REFACTOR**: Clean up the code while tests stay green

Don't worry if this feels abstract; Level 5 shows a concrete example that makes it click.
