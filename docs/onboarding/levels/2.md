> 📷 **[Image Generation Prompt]**: Create an illustration showing a transparent view of AAID's structure. Center: A single markdown file with visible text showing "## TDD Cycle Phases" and "RED → GREEN → REFACTOR" with structured formatting. Around it, show 3-4 optional command shortcuts floating like helper cards with labels "/research-&-stop", "/ai-roadmap-template". The files should appear light and simple, not heavy or complex. Bottom corner: Multiple AI tool logos (Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT) connected by dotted lines to the markdown file, showing compatibility. Use a clean, professional graphic style with a light background and tech-blue accent colors. The overall mood should convey simplicity and transparency, not complexity.

Let's demystify what AAID actually is. **There's no magic**: just two simple things.

### 1. A Rules File (Instructions for Your AI)

`AAID` is a markdown file containing [instructions](../../../rules/aaid/aaid-development-rules.mdc) that teach your AI assistant TDD discipline. Here's the core structure:

```markdown
## TDD Cycle Phases

### 🔴 RED Phase - Write Failing Test

**Core Principle:** Write only enough test code to fail
**On Success:** Present test and result, then STOP AND AWAIT USER REVIEW

### 🟢 GREEN Phase - Make Test Pass

**Core Principle:** Write only enough production code to make the test pass
**On Success:** Present implementation, then STOP AND AWAIT USER REVIEW

### 🧼 REFACTOR Phase - Improve Code Quality

**Core Principle:** Improve code structure with passing tests as safety net
**On Success:** Present outcome, then STOP AND AWAIT USER REVIEW
```

That's it. The file guides AI behavior with structured text: what to do in each phase, when to stop for review. **No installation, no dependencies**, just markdown.

The file goes in `.cursor/rules/aaid.mdc` (Cursor), `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code), or similar for other AI tools.

### 2. Optional Commands (Shortcuts)

Instead of typing long requests repeatedly, create shortcuts. For example:

**Long version:**

> "How does authentication work in this codebase? Show me the patterns we use, find similar examples, check what testing approaches we have, and report back without changing anything. Check
> the web if you need more documentation!"

**Shortcut version:**

```
/research-&-stop auth
```

The AI explores authentication patterns, searches docs, and summarizes findings.

**Other useful shortcuts:**

- `/ai-roadmap-template` - Creates test planning document
- `/project-context [files]` - Establishes project understanding

Commands are pre-written prompts stored as markdown files. Completely optional (you can type everything manually).

> More reusable prompts: [Appendix B](../../../appendices/appendix-b/reusable-prompts.md)

**Why this works:** Rules keep AI on track without constant reminders. Commands save typing. Everything is transparent markdown you can read, edit, and version control. Works with any AI tool supporting custom instructions (Cursor, Claude Code, ChatGPT, etc.).

### Quick TDD Primer (If You're New to Testing)

Here's the 30-second version:

**What's a test?** Code that automatically checks if your code works (instead of manual testing).

**What's TDD?** Write the test FIRST (before the feature exists), then write just enough code to make it pass. This prevents over-engineering.

**The three phases:**

- **🔴 RED**: Write a test for something that doesn't exist yet (it fails)
- **🟢 GREEN**: Write the simplest code to make it pass
- **🧼 REFACTOR**: Clean up the code while tests stay green

Don't worry if this feels abstract; Level 4 shows a concrete example that makes it click.
