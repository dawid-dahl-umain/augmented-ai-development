## Onboarding Level 2: How AAID Actually Works (Under the Hood)

> 📷 **[Image Generation Prompt]**: Create an illustration showing a transparent view of AAID's structure. Center: A single markdown file with visible text showing "## TDD Cycle Phases" and "RED → GREEN → REFACTOR" with structured formatting. Around it, show 3-4 optional command shortcuts floating like helper cards with labels "/research-&-stop", "/ai-roadmap-template". The files should appear light and simple, not heavy or complex. Bottom corner: Multiple AI tool logos (Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT) connected by dotted lines to the markdown file, showing compatibility. Use a clean, professional graphic style with a light background and tech-blue accent colors. The overall mood should convey simplicity and transparency, not complexity.

Before seeing AAID in action, let's demystify what it actually is. Spoiler: **there's no magic**. AAID is just two simple things:

### 1. A Rules File (Instructions for Your AI)

AAID is a markdown file containing [instructions](../../../rules/aaid/aaid-development-rules.mdc) that teach your AI assistant to follow TDD discipline. Here's a tiny peek:

```markdown
## TDD Cycle Phases

### 🔴 RED Phase - Write Failing Test

**Core Principle:** Write only enough test code to fail
**On Success:** Present test and result, then STOP AND AWAIT USER REVIEW

### 🟢 GREEN Phase - Make Test Pass

**Core Principle:** Write only enough production code to make the test pass
**On Success:** Present implementation, then STOP AND AWAIT USER REVIEW

### 🧼 REFACTOR Phase - Improve Code Quality

**Core Principle:** Improve code structure with passing tests as safety net
**On Success:** Present outcome, then STOP AND AWAIT USER REVIEW
```

That's the essence. The file contains detailed instructions for each stage and phase, but it's just structured text guiding the AI's behavior. **No installation, no dependencies, no config files**. Just a single markdown file for the AI.

**Where does it go?**

- Cursor: `.cursor/rules/aaid.mdc`
- Claude Code: `CLAUDE.md` in project root
- Other tools: Similar pattern

### 2. Optional Commands (Shortcuts to Speed You Up)

Instead of typing long requests repeatedly, you can create shortcuts. For example:

**Instead of typing:**

> "How does authentication work in this codebase? Show me the patterns we use, find similar examples, check what testing approaches we have, and report back without changing anything. Check the web if you need more documentation!"

**You can simply type:**

```
/research-&-stop auth
```

The AI will explore authentication patterns in your codebase, search relevant documentation, and summarize findings; saving you from typing the full request every time you need to explore something.

**Other useful shortcuts:**

- `/ai-roadmap-template` - Creates a test planning document for a feature
- `/project-context [args]` - Establishes comprehensive project understanding

These commands are just pre-written prompts stored as markdown files. They're completely optional, you can type everything manually if you prefer.

### Why This Matters

**Speed:**

- Commands save you from typing repetitive requests
- Rules keep the AI on track without constant reminders
- You spend less time instructing, more time building

**Simple and transparent:**

- No proprietary tooling or black boxes
- Just markdown files you can read, edit, and version control
- Works with any AI tool that supports custom instructions (Cursor, Claude Code, ChatGPT, etc.)

**🛑 Checkpoint**: Got it?

- **"This sounds simple!"** → It is! Continue to [Level 3](./3.md) to see it in action
- **"Can I see the full rules file?"** → Check [Appendix C](../../aidd-workflow.md#appendix-c) in the main guide
- **"What about setup details?"** → Jump to [Getting Started](./get-started.md)
