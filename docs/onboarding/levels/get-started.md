## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Step 1: Add the Workflow Rules

Save the [AAID rules](../../../appendices/appendix-c/aaid-ai-workflow-rules.md) to your project:

- **Cursor**: `.cursor/rules/aaid.mdc`
- **Claude Code**: `CLAUDE.md` in project root
- **Other AI tools**: Check their docs for "custom instructions" location

### Step 2: Add Commands (Optional but Recommended)

Copy [reusable prompts](../../../appendices/appendix-b/reusable-prompts.md) for shortcuts like `/red-&-stop`:

- **Cursor**: `.cursor/commands/` directory
- **Claude Code**: `.claude/commands/` directory

### Step 3: Bookmark the Workflow

Keep the [AAID workflow diagram](../../../aaid-workflow-diagram.mermaid) handy as your reference.

**Ready to code?** → Start with [Getting Started With AAID](../../aidd-workflow.md#getting-started-with-aaid) in the main guide

**Want deeper understanding?** → Read the [complete AAID guide](../../aidd-workflow.md) (45 min)

**Have specific questions?** Check the appendices:

- [Implementation Categories](../../../appendices/appendix-d/handling-technical-implementation-details.md) (frontend, backend, infrastructure)
- [Dependencies and Mocking](../../../appendices/appendix-e/dependencies-and-mocking.md)
- [Acceptance Testing](../../../appendices/appendix-a/unit-testing-and-acceptance-testing.md)

## 🎯 Your First Feature

Pick a small, well-specified feature and follow the workflow:

1. **Stage 1**: Provide context
2. **Stage 2**: Plan with AI
3. **Stage 3**: Start TDD
4. **Stage 4**: RED → Review → GREEN → Review → REFACTOR → Review → Repeat

Remember: The rhythm becomes natural after 2-3 features.
