> 🎉 **Congratulations!** You've completed the conceptual onboarding. You now understand what AAID is, why it matters, and how it works. Now it's time to actually set it up and use it in your project.

If you've made it this far, you understand the AAID concepts. Now it's time to actually set it up and use it in your project.

### Next Steps

1. **Set up AAID in your project**  
   → See [Getting Started With AAID](../../aidd-workflow.md#getting-started-with-aaid) in the main guide

   - Add the workflow rules
   - Add reusable commands (optional but recommended)
   - Keep the workflow diagram handy

2. **Read the complete workflow guide**  
   → [AAID: Augmented AI Development - Full Guide](../../aidd-workflow.md)

   - Detailed explanations of each stage
   - Real-world examples
   - Common pitfalls and solutions

3. **See it in action**  
   → [TicTacToe Demo Repository](https://github.com/dawid-dahl-umain/augmented-ai-development-demo)

   - 100% AI-generated code using AAID
   - Unit tests and acceptance tests
   - Hexagonal architecture example

4. **Practice with a simple feature**
   - Pick a small, well-specified feature
   - Follow the 4-stage workflow
   - Do complete RED/GREEN/REFACTOR cycles
   - Review every phase yourself

### What Makes AAID Different

Other AI workflows:

- ❌ Generate massive code dumps
- ❌ Use checkbox "task lists" (unverifiable)
- ❌ No mandatory review points
- ❌ Trust AI judgment for "done"

AAID:

- ✅ Small, focused steps
- ✅ Automated tests (objective, re-runnable)
- ✅ Mandatory review after every phase
- ✅ You decide what's "done"

### Remember the Mindset

1. 🧠 **Don't check your brain at the door** - Understand every line
2. 🪜 **Incremental steps** - One test, one feature, one refactor at a time

### The Business Case

With AAID, you get:

- **Speed**: AI handles code generation
- **Stability**: TDD ensures quality
- **Understanding**: Reviews keep you in control

DORA proves speed and stability aren't trade-offs. With AAID, you get both.

**That's the augmented advantage.**
