After seeing TDD catch AI mistakes in Level 5, you might wonder: _"OK, but will this work for MY specific situation?"_

Let's address common concerns:

**Quick Navigation:**

- [I'm working on frontend code](#frontend)
- [I'm working on backend business logic](#backend)
- [I'm building technical infrastructure](#infrastructure)
- [I need to write E2E tests](#e2e)
- [I'm working on pure styling/animations](#styling)
- [Will this work with microservices?](#microservices)
- [What about project setup and scaffolding?](#scaffolding)
- [I'm confused about what to mock in tests](#mocking)

### 🙋 _"I'm working on frontend code"_

**`AAID` works for frontend too:** Remember the three ways from Level 3?

- **Way 1: Frontend behavioral logic** (form validation, state management, data transformations) → Uses TDD just like backend
- **Way 3: Pure presentation** (colors, animations, spacing) → Skip TDD, use manual validation
- **Way 2: Frontend infrastructure** (HTTP clients, cache adapters) → Uses TDD with integration tests

**Example**: A React form component would have:

- Unit tests for validation logic ✅
- Unit tests for state management ✅
- Manual validation for CSS styling ✅

**Common misconception**: "TDD doesn't work for frontend." Not true! You just need to know what to test vs. what to validate manually.

<a id="backend"></a>

### 🙋 _"I'm working on backend business logic"_

The main guide focuses heavily on this because it's where TDD works perfectly:

- **Pure business logic** → Unit tests with mocked dependencies
- **Domain models** → Test behavior, not implementation
- **Service layers** → Test orchestration and business rules

The password validation example from Level 5 is a typical example of backend logic that benefits from TDD (Way 1: Business Behavior).

<a id="infrastructure"></a>

### 🙋 _"I'm building technical infrastructure (adapters, repositories, etc.)"_

**`AAID` handles infrastructure differently:** This is Way 2 from Level 3:

- **Database adapters** → Integration tests with real DB (managed dependency)
- **External API clients** → Contract tests with mocked endpoints (unmanaged dependency)
- **Message queue handlers** → Integration tests with real queue

The key difference: Instead of unit tests with mocks, you use integration/contract tests that verify technical contracts.

<a id="e2e"></a>

### 🙋 _"I need to write E2E tests (like Playwright)"_

**`AAID` covers this through acceptance testing:**

- Tests the whole system from the outside
- Mocks only external dependencies you don't control
- Keeps tests fast and deterministic
- Uses Dave Farley's Four-Layer architecture

**Different from E2E**: Acceptance tests mock third-party APIs to avoid flaky tests from external failures.

<a id="styling"></a>

### 🙋 _"I'm working on pure styling/animations"_

**`AAID` knows when NOT to use TDD:** This is Way 3 from Level 3:

For pure presentation (CSS, animations, visual design):

- Skip TDD entirely - no logic to test
- Use manual validation
- Visual regression testing if needed
- Accessibility audits

**Why?** Styling is an implementation detail. Also, often you're validating the "feel", something only humans can judge.

<a id="microservices"></a>

### 🙋 _"Will this work with microservices?"_

**Yes, `AAID` works well with microservices:**

- Each microservice uses `AAID` internally just like any regular service
- While testing:
  - During development: mock other services for fast feedback
  - Pre-deployment: uses [bidirectional contract tests](../../../appendices/appendix-e/dependencies-and-mocking.md) with real service connections
- The `AAID` workflow stays the same

<a id="scaffolding"></a>

### 🙋 _"What about project setup and scaffolding?"_

**Project scaffolding sits outside `AAID`'s workflow:**

- Running framework generators (`create-vite`, `create-next-app`, etc.)
- Installing packages and configuring build tools
- Setting up linters, formatters, test runners
- Basic config files that have no custom behavior

**How to verify?** Run it once; if it works, you're done. [Acceptance tests](../../../appendices/appendix-a/docs/aaid-acceptance-testing-workflow.md) will catch integration issues if something breaks.

**When does `AAID` apply?** When you write _custom code_:

- ✅ Business logic → Use `AAID` with unit tests
- ✅ Custom infrastructure (adapters, API clients, middleware, etc.) → Use `AAID` with integration tests
- ✅ Presentation/UI (styling, animations) → Use `AAID` workflow, skip TDD, manual validation
- ✅ Verify system meets business requirements → Use `AAID` with acceptance tests
- ❌ Scaffolding (npm install, test runner setup, config files) → No `AAID`, just set up. (Acceptance test will catch issues)

See [Appendix D](../../../appendices/appendix-d/handling-technical-implementation-details.md#scaffolding-and-prerequisites) for the complete distinction.

<a id="mocking"></a>

### 🙋 _"I'm confused about what to mock in tests"_

**`AAID` has clear rules:**

- **Unit tests**: Mock everything external
- **Integration tests**: Use real managed dependencies (your DB), mock unmanaged (third-party APIs)
- **Acceptance tests**: Same as integration
- **E2E tests**: `AAID` uses Acceptance Tests

There's a complete [decision diagram](../../../appendices/appendix-e/dependencies-mocking-decision-flow.mermaid) in the appendices when you need it.

**🛑 Checkpoint**: Found your situation?

- **Yes, I see how `AAID` applies to me** → Continue to [Level 7](./7.md) to see code generated using `AAID`
- **My situation isn't listed** → The principles still apply! Check the main guide's appendices for edge cases
- **Still skeptical** → Fair enough! [Level 7](./7.md) shows actual code that might convince you
