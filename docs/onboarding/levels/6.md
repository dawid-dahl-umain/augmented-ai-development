Based on your situation, here's what you'll eventually need to learn. Don't worry about mastering everything now—you can come back as needed.

### For Everyone

**Core AAID concepts** (Levels 0-4 above):

- ✓ The developer mindset
- ✓ The 4-stage workflow
- ✓ The TDD cycle (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR)

### Based on Your Work

#### 🙋🏻 _"I'm working on business logic and features"_

**You'll need**:

- **Unit testing with TDD** (covered in main guide)
  - Writing behavioral tests
  - Mocking external dependencies
  - The Given/When/Then structure

**Eventually you'll want**:

- **[Appendix A: Understanding the difference between unit tests and acceptance tests](../../../appendices/appendix-a/unit-testing-and-acceptance-testing.md)**
  - Unit tests = "Is my code technically correct?"
  - Acceptance tests = "Is my system releasable?"
  - When you need both

#### 🙋🏻 _"I'm working on frontend"_

**You'll need to understand**:

- **[Appendix D: The three implementation categories](../../../appendices/appendix-d/handling-technical-implementation-details.md)**
  - Frontend behavioral logic (form validation, state management) → Uses TDD
  - Frontend presentation (colors, animations, spacing) → No TDD, manual validation
  - Frontend infrastructure (HTTP clients, cache adapters) → Uses TDD with integration tests

**Common misconception**: "TDD doesn't work for frontend." Not true! You just need to know what to test vs. what to validate manually.

#### 🙋🏻 _"I'm building more technical infrastructure stuff (adapters, repositories, etc.)"_

**You'll need**:

- **[Appendix D: Handling technical implementation](../../../appendices/appendix-d/handling-technical-implementation-details.md)**
  - Non-Observable Technical category
  - Integration tests vs contract tests
  - Testing technical contracts without testing the domain again

**You'll also need**:

- **[Appendix E: Dependencies and mocking strategies](../../../appendices/appendix-e/dependencies-and-mocking.md)**
  - When to use real dependencies vs mocks
  - Integration tests (managed dependencies)
  - Contract tests (unmanaged dependencies)

#### 🙋🏻 _"I need E2E-style—like Playwright—tests that test the system as a whole"_

**You'll need**:

- **[Appendix A: Acceptance testing with the Four-Layer Model](../../../appendices/appendix-a/docs/aaid-acceptance-testing-workflow.md)**
  - Dave Farley's Four-Layer architecture
  - Executable specifications with DSL
  - Three levels of test isolation
  - How to keep acceptance tests fast and reliable

**Why not just E2E?** Acceptance tests mock external dependencies you don't control, keeping tests deterministic and fast.

#### 🙋🏻 _"I'm confused about what to mock while testing"_

**You'll need**:

- **[Appendix E: Dependencies and mocking](../../../appendices/appendix-e/dependencies-and-mocking.md)**
  - Four dependency categories
  - Decision flow diagram
  - Different strategies for unit/integration/contract/acceptance tests
  - Check the [mocking decision diagram](../../../appendices/appendix-e/dependencies-mocking-decision-flow.mermaid)

**Quick rule of thumb**:

- Unit tests: Mock everything external
- Integration tests: Use real managed dependencies (your DB)
- Acceptance tests: Use real managed, mock unmanaged (third-party APIs)

#### 🙋🏻 _"I'm working on pure styling, animations, or visual design"_

**You'll need**:

- **[Appendix D: Observable Technical category](../../../appendices/appendix-d/handling-technical-implementation-details.md#validation-workflow-for-observable-technical)**
  - When NOT to use TDD
  - Manual validation workflow
  - Visual regression testing
  - Accessibility audits

**Key insight**: Pure presentation has no logic to test. You validate the "feel"—something only humans can judge.

### Reusable Commands & Tooling

When you're ready to speed up your workflow:

- **[Appendix B: Reusable prompts](../../../appendices/appendix-b/reusable-prompts.md)**

  - Setup & planning commands
  - TDD cycle commands (`/red-&-stop`, etc)
  - Investigation & problem-solving commands
  - Utility commands

- **[Appendix C: AI workflow rules](../../../appendices/appendix-c/aaid-ai-workflow-rules.md)**
  - Rules file that teaches your AI the AAID workflow
  - How to configure for Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini, etc

**🛑 Checkpoint**: Do you know what you'll need?

- **Yes, I understand my path** → Ready to start for real! See below.
- **Need clarification on categories** → Read the specific appendix links above
- **Still overwhelming** → That's okay! Start with basic TDD (Levels 0-4), learn advanced topics as needed
