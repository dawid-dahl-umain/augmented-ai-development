**‚è±Ô∏è Time: 5 minutes (reading guide) + as needed for main guide**

> üí° **You've learned the basics!** You understand the problem, the mindset, how it works, the workflow structure, and you've seen TDD catch real AI overengineering. Now it's time for the comprehensive details.

At this point, you're ready for the **complete AAID guide** which covers everything in depth. But that guide is comprehensive (1300+ lines!), so here's how to approach it strategically.

### üìñ Your Reading Guide to the Main AAID Documentation

Instead of duplicating everything here, let me guide you through the main guide efficiently:

#### **If you want to start practicing right now:**

‚Üí Jump to [Getting Started With AAID](../../aidd-workflow.md#getting-started-with-aaid)

- 3-step setup (takes 5 minutes)
- Then practice on a simple feature

#### **If you want comprehensive understanding first:**

Read these sections in order:

1. **[Stage 1: Context Providing](../../aidd-workflow.md#stage-1-context)** (10 min)

   - Learn how to give AI the right project context
   - Understand the three implementation categories
   - See what context to provide based on what you're building

2. **[Stage 2: Planning](../../aidd-workflow.md#stage-2-planning)** (10 min)

   - Learn what planning IS and IS NOT
   - Understand roadmaps vs implementation
   - See why AAID uses tests instead of task-list checkboxes

3. **[Stage 3: TDD Starts](../../aidd-workflow.md#stage-3-tdd-begins)** (5 min)

   - Understand test list vs single test approaches
   - Learn Kent Beck's living document philosophy

4. **[Stage 4: The TDD Cycle](../../aidd-workflow.md#stage-4-tdd-cycle)** (20 min)
   - Deep dive into RED, GREEN, REFACTOR phases
   - See detailed examples with full code
   - Learn the review checklists for each phase

#### **If you have specific questions:**

- **"What exactly do I provide in Stage 1?"** ‚Üí [Context Providing - Steps](../../aidd-workflow.md#stage-1-context)
- **"How do I know if I should use unit tests vs integration tests?"** ‚Üí [Appendix D: Implementation Categories](../../../appendices/appendix-d/handling-technical-implementation-details.md)
- **"What's the difference between unit and acceptance tests?"** ‚Üí [Appendix A](../../../appendices/appendix-a/unit-testing-and-acceptance-testing.md)
- **"What should I mock?"** ‚Üí [Appendix E: Dependencies and Mocking](../../../appendices/appendix-e/dependencies-and-mocking.md)

#### **Pro tip: Don't try to memorize everything**

The main guide is reference documentation - you're not expected to memorize it. Once you understand the core concepts:

**The [workflow diagram](../../../aaid-workflow-diagram.mermaid) becomes your working companion:**

- Shows you exactly where you are in the process
- Reminds you of the review checkpoints
- Shows the three development paths (domain, technical, presentation)

**The main guide provides the details when you need them:**

- Forgot what goes in Stage 1 context? ‚Üí Look it up
- Unclear about a phase's checklist? ‚Üí Reference it
- Need to understand implementation categories? ‚Üí Read that section

After 2-3 features, the workflow becomes natural and you'll rarely need either.

**üõë Checkpoint**: Ready for the next step?

- **Yes, I'll read the main guide now** ‚Üí Use the reading guide above to navigate efficiently
- **I want to understand more first** ‚Üí Re-read sections that interest you
- **I'm ready to start practicing** ‚Üí Jump to ["Ready to Start for Real?"](./get-started.md) for setup
