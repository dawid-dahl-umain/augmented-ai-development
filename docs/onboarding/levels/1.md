> 💡 **Real Talk**: You're already working with AI in Cursor. AAID just adds structure so you maintain control and understanding. It's not about doing MORE work—it's about doing AI work SAFELY.

Success with AAID requires two core principles:

### 1. 🧠 Stay Engaged with Every Line of Code

You must **comprehend every line** of code, every test, every refactoring.

- The AI generates the code
- **You** decide what stays, what changes, what gets removed, and why
- No blind copy-pasting
- No "hoping it works"

**Why?** Without understanding, you're just pushing bugs to production with extra steps.

### 2. 🪜 Incremental Steps with Review Checkpoints

Instead of letting AI run wild for minutes generating massive amounts of code:

- **Small, focused steps**: One test at a time. One feature at a time. One refactor at a time.
- **Review checkpoints**: Mandatory pause points after each phase
- **Stay in control**: Surface mistakes early, save money on tokens

**The AAID cycle adds review points after EVERY phase:**

```
🔴 RED (write failing test) → ⏸️ REVIEW →
🟢 GREEN (make it pass) → ⏸️ REVIEW →
🧼 REFACTOR (improve code) → ⏸️ REVIEW →
Next test...
```

> The review pauses are added automatically by the AI via the [instructions file](../../../rules/aaid/aaid-development-rules.mdc). You'll learn more about this in [the next Level](./2.md).

This mirrors [DORA research on working in small batches](https://dora.dev/capabilities/working-in-small-batches/): tiny, independent changes give faster feedback and reduce risk.

**🛑 Checkpoint**: Do these principles make sense to you?

- **Yes, I want to maintain control** → Continue to [Level 2](./2.md) to see how it works
- **Want to see concrete examples first** → Skip to [Level 4](./4.md) to see TDD catch real mistakes
- **I want to understand more first** → Keep reading, we'll explain everything
