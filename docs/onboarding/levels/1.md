**⏱️ Time: 5 minutes**

> 📷 **[Image Generation Prompt]**: Create an illustration of a developer sitting at a modern desk setup with dual monitors. The developer appears calm and in control. Above their workspace, show the AI as a friendly holographic assistant (semi-transparent blue). Between them, visualize the workflow as three floating panels labeled 'RED', 'GREEN', and 'REFACTOR', each with a pause symbol (⏸️) after it. The panels should glow softly to show they're interactive checkpoints. Use a clean, professional graphic style with a light background and tech-blue accent colors. The overall mood should convey partnership and control, not automation.

> 💡 **Real Talk**: You're already working with AI in Cursor. AAID just adds structure so you maintain control and understanding. It's not about doing MORE work, it's about doing AI work SAFELY.

Success with `AAID` requires two core principles:

### 1. 🧠 Stay Engaged with Every Line of Code

You must **comprehend every line** of code, every test, every refactoring.

- The AI generates the code
- **You** decide what stays, what changes, what gets removed, and why
- No blind copy-pasting
- No "hoping it works"

**Why?** Without understanding, you're just pushing bugs to production with extra steps.

### 2. 🪜 Incremental Steps with Review Checkpoints

Instead of letting AI run wild for minutes or hours generating massive amounts of code:

- **Small, focused steps**: One test at a time. One feature at a time. One refactor at a time.
- **Review checkpoints**: Mandatory pause points after each phase
- **Stay in control**: Surface mistakes early, save money on tokens

**The AAID cycle adds review points after EVERY phase:**

```
🔴 RED (write failing test) → ⏸️ REVIEW →
🟢 GREEN (make it pass) → ⏸️ REVIEW →
🧼 REFACTOR (improve code) → ⏸️ REVIEW →
Next test...
```

> The review pauses are added automatically by the AI via the [instructions file](../../../rules/aaid/aaid-development-rules.mdc). You'll learn more about this in [the next Level](./2.md).

**🛑 Checkpoint**: Do these principles make sense to you?

- **Yes, I want to maintain control** → Continue to [Level 2](./2.md) to see how it works
- **Want to see concrete examples first** → Skip to [Level 3](./3.md) for a walkthrough
- **I want to understand more first** → Keep reading, the next levels will explain everything
