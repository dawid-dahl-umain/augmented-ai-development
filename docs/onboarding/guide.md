# AAID Onboarding Guide

_A gentle introduction to Augmented AI Development_

![AAID Onboarding Guide](../../assets/onboarding/guide.webp)

**Welcome!** You're here because you (or your team) want to use AI coding assistants like Cursor safely and professionally. This guide teaches you **AAID** (Augmented AI Development): a workflow that combines AI speed with quality control.

## üöÄ Too Busy? Quick Summary

**What you'll learn**: A disciplined workflow for AI-assisted coding where AI generates code fast, but YOU review every step and stay in control.

**Why it matters**: Without structure, AI coding leads to unsafe, buggy and unmaintainable code. It also slows you down, due to all the extra debugging needed. `AAID` prevents this.

**What you get**: It unlocks AI's actual productivity potential, without sacrificing code quality or your understanding.

**Time needed**: ~70 minutes to complete the onboarding, 2-3 features to get comfortable, fairly fluent after 2-3 weeks of daily use.

> That said, **Test-Driven Development**, which `AAID` builds on, is an art. And like any art form, there's always something new to discover. The basics are quick to learn, early wins come fast, but the journey toward mastery will keep your work interesting for years to come.

## What Are Onboarding Levels?

This guide is organized into **progressive onboarding levels**. Each level builds on the previous one:

- **You can stop at any level** and come back later
- **You can skip ahead** if you want (though we don't recommend it)
- **Each level has a time estimate** so you know the commitment
- **Each level ends with a checkpoint** where you decide: continue now or take a break

Think of it like a video game tutorial: start at Level 0, work your way up, and unlock understanding at your own pace.
