# AAID Onboarding Guide

_A gentle introduction to Augmented AI Development_

---

**Welcome!** You're here because you (or your team) want to use AI coding assistants like Cursor safely and professionally. This guide teaches you **AAID** (Augmented AI Development): a framework that combines AI speed with quality control.

## ðŸš€ Too Busy? Quick Summary

**What you'll learn**: A disciplined workflow for AI-assisted coding where AI generates code fast, but YOU review every step and stay in control.

**Why it matters**: Without structure, AI coding leads to bugs you don't understand. AAID prevents this while keeping AI's speed benefits.

**What you get**: AI's productivity without sacrificing code quality or your understanding.

**Time needed**: ~1 hour to learn the concepts, then you'll practice on real features.

**Ready?** Start at Level 0 below â†“

## What Are These "Levels"?

This guide is organized into **progressive learning stages** (we call them "Onboarding Levels"). Each level builds on the previous one:

- **You can stop at any level** and come back later
- **You can skip ahead** if you want (though we don't recommend it)
- **Each level has a time estimate** so you know the commitment
- **Each level ends with a checkpoint** where you decide: continue, take a break, or try something else

Think of it like a video game tutorial: start at Level 0, work your way up, and unlock understanding at your own pace.
