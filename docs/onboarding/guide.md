# AAID Onboarding Guide

_A gentle introduction to Augmented AI Development_

> ðŸ“· **[Image Generation Prompt]**: Create a welcoming illustration showing a learning journey as a game-like level progression map. Show 8 connected nodes arranged in an ascending path from bottom-left to top-right: Levels 0-5 as progressive stepping stones, then "Choose Path" as a branching node, then "Get Started" at the top with a flag or star. Each node should have a subtle number badge. Small icons representing the content (problem/solution, brain, gears, workflow, shield, lightbulb, paths, rocket) should float near their respective nodes. A friendly AI holographic assistant guides from the side. Use a clean, professional graphic style with a light background and tech-blue accent colors. The overall mood should convey an achievable learning journey with clear progression and support.

**Welcome!** You're here because you (or your team) want to use AI coding assistants like Cursor safely and professionally. This guide teaches you **AAID** (Augmented AI Development): a framework that combines AI speed with quality control.

## ðŸš€ Too Busy? Quick Summary

**What you'll learn**: A disciplined workflow for AI-assisted coding where AI generates code fast, but YOU review every step and stay in control.

**Why it matters**: Without structure, AI coding leads to bugs you don't understand. AAID prevents this while keeping AI's speed benefits.

**What you get**: AI's productivity without sacrificing code quality or your understanding.

**Time needed**: ~45 minutes to understand the concepts, 1-2 features to get comfortable (2-3 weeks), fluent after 2-3 weeks of daily use.

**Ready?** Start at Onboarding Level 0 below â†“

## What Are Onboarding Levels?

This guide is organized into **progressive onboarding levels**. Each level builds on the previous one:

- **You can stop at any level** and come back later
- **You can skip ahead** if you want (though we don't recommend it)
- **Each level has a time estimate** so you know the commitment
- **Each level ends with a checkpoint** where you decide: continue now or take a break

Think of it like a video game tutorial: start at Level 0, work your way up, and unlock understanding at your own pace.
