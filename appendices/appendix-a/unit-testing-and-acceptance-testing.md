# Appendix A: Unit Testing and Acceptance Testing

![Appendix A](../../assets/appendices/7.webp)

This article on `AAID` focuses on TDD (Test-Driven Development) for **Unit Testing**, which ensures you actually write your code correctly and with high quality.

**Acceptance Testing**, on the other hand, verifies that your software aligns with business goals and is actually _done_. It serves as an executable definition-of-done.

Understanding how these two testing strategies complement each other is crucial for professional developers, as both are invaluable parts of writing production-grade software.

| Acceptance Testing is similar to E2E testing; both test the full app flow, via the system boundaries.<br><br>The key difference: AT mocks external dependencies you don't control (third-party APIs, etc) while keeping internal dependencies you do control (your database, etc) real. E2E usually mocks nothing and runs everything together.<br><br>Problem with E2E: Tests fail due to external factors (third-party outages, network issues) rather than your code. Acceptance Testing isolates your system so failures indicate real business logic problems, or technical issues that you are responsible for. |

The two kinds of tests answer different questions:

- **TDD (Unit Tests)**: "_Is my code technically correct?_"
- **ATDD (Acceptance Tests)**: "_Is my system releasable after this change?_"

So in short: `AAID` builds the solution, Acceptance Tests confirm it‚Äôs the right solution.

## Key Differences

**Unit Tests (TDD/`AAID`)**

- Answer: "_Is my code technically correct?_"
- Fine-grained, developer-focused testing
- Mock all external dependencies
- Test suite should run in seconds to tens-of-seconds
- Apply design pressure through testability
- Can but doesn't necessarily map 1:1 to user stories/acceptance criteria
- Guide code quality and modularity
- Part of the fast feedback loop in CI/CD

Example of what a unit test looks like:

```tsx
describe("TodoService", () => {
  it("should archive a completed todo", async () => {
    // Given
    const completedTodo = { id: "todo-1", title: "Buy milk", completed: true }
    mockTodoRepository.findById.mockResolvedValue(completedTodo)

    // When
    const result = await service.archiveTodo("todo-1")

    // Then
    expect(result.isOk()).toBe(true)
    expect(mockTodoRepository.moveToArchive).toHaveBeenCalledWith(completedTodo)
    expect(mockTodoRepository.removeFromActive).toHaveBeenCalledWith("todo-1")
  })
})
```

**Acceptance Tests (ATDD/BDD)**

- Answer: "_Does the system meet business requirements?_"
- Business specification validation through user-visible features
- Test in a production-like environment through system boundaries
- Mock unmanaged external dependencies (like third-party APIs)
  - Don't mock managed external dependencies (like app's database)
- Test suite will run slower than unit tests
- Maps 1:1 to user stories/acceptance criteria
- Verify the system is ready for release
- Stakeholder-focused (though developers + AI implement)

Example of what an acceptance test looks like (using the [Four-Layer](https://dojoconsortium.org/assets/ATDD%20-%20How%20to%20Guide.pdf) model pioneered by Dave Farley):

| Layer                             | Description                             |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1. Executable Specification       | The test                                |
| 2. Domain-Specific Language (DSL) | Business vocabulary                     |
| 3. Driver                         | Bridge between DSL and SUT              |
| 4. System Under Test (SUT)        | Production-like application environment |

```tsx
import { user, todo } from "../dsl"

describe("User archives completed todos", () => {
  it("should archive a completed todo", async () => {
    // Given
    await user.startsWithNewAccount()
    await user.hasCompletedTodo("Buy milk")

    // When
    await todo.archive("Buy milk")

    // Then
    todo.confirmInArchive("Buy milk")
    todo.confirmNotInActive("Buy milk")
  })
})
```

_Acceptance tests know nothing about how our app works internally. Even if the app changes its technical implementation details, this specification (test) will remain valid._

In acceptance tests, every DSL call follows the same flow: **Test ‚Üí DSL ‚Üí Driver ‚Üí SUT**.

The DSL provides business vocabulary (like `user` or `archive todo`), while the driver **connects to your SUT from the outside (through APIs, UI, or other entry points)**. This separation keeps tests readable and maintainable.

Notice how unit tests directly test the class with mocks, while acceptance tests use this DSL layer to express tests in business terms.

| **Note on Integration Testing**: While this guide focuses on unit testing through TDD, `AAID` also applies to integration testing. Integration tests verify a single infrastructure element's technical contract by testing it with only its immediate managed dependency (e.g., a repository adapter with real database). Unmanaged dependencies are mocked. See [Appendix E](../appendix-e/dependencies-and-mocking.md) for complete dependency handling guidelines. |

In `AAID`, AI helps you rapidly write unit tests and implementations. Knowing the difference between unit and acceptance testing prevents you from mistaking 'technically correct code' for 'done features,' a crucial distinction in professional development.
