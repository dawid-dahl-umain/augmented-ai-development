# AI Acceptance Testing Mode Rules

When this mode is active, ignore the default AAID/TDD rules for matching acceptance-testing files.

## Core Concepts

**Four-Layer Model:**

- **Layer 1: Executable Specs** - WHAT in business language, only calls DSL
- **Layer 2: DSL** - pure translation layer, depends only on ProtocolDriver interface
  - NO assertions, NO business logic, stateless (SUT is source of truth)
  - Only logic allowed: parameter handling and aliasing for test isolation
- **Layer 3: Protocol Drivers + Stubs** - HOW system is accessed, implements ProtocolDriver interface
  - Stateless (query SUT for verification), contains ALL assertions/failures (throws Error)
- **Layer 4: SUT** - your actual deployed system (includes your DB, cache, services)

**Isolation (enables parallel & repeated test runs):**

Why isolation matters: Acceptance tests run against production-like SUT with real DB/cache (slower than unit tests). To keep test suites fast, we run tests in parallel. Isolation prevents tests from interfering with each other.

- **Functional isolation**: Each test creates unique domain partition (e.g., user account with aliased email)
- **Temporal isolation**: `params.alias("email")` takes `"user@test.com"` from args → returns `"user@test.com1"`, `"user@test.com2"`, etc.
- Alias identifiers that establish boundaries or must stay unique (emails, usernames, todo names, order IDs)
- Use `params.optional()` for descriptive or non-unique fields (passwords, descriptions, roles)
- Use `params.optionalSequence()` for deterministic sequential values and `params.optionalList()` for list defaults when scenarios omit them

**Stubbing:**

- Stub ONLY external third-party APIs you don't control (payment gateways, email services)
- NEVER stub your own database, cache, or internal services - they're part of your SUT

**BDD → Code transformation:**

```gherkin
Given the user has an account
And they have a completed todo "Buy milk"
```

becomes:

```typescript
await dsl.user.hasAccount({ email: "user@test.com" })
await dsl.user.hasCompletedTodo({ name: "Buy milk" })
```

## Primary Goal

Transform BDD scenarios (Given-When-Then format) into executable acceptance tests using the Four-Layer Model.

**Required Input:** BDD scenarios. If not provided, ask user for them before proceeding.

**Development Order:** AAID does not prescribe SUT-first or test-first. Teams choose their approach. Test outcomes depend on SUT readiness; both passing (SUT exists) and failing (test-first) are valid.

## Mode Recognition

**Acceptance Testing mode is ACTIVE when:**

- User explicitly requests acceptance testing, ATDD, transforming BDD scenarios, or work with the Four-Layer Model
- User provides BDD scenarios and asks for executable specifications, DSL layers, or protocol drivers
- Work happens inside `acceptance-test/**` touching Layer 1–3 artifacts

**NOT active:** Normal context sharing, unit-test/TDD work, or presentation-only changes

## Acceptance Testing Workflow Sequence

1. **Stage 1: Context** - Gather project/feature context, BDD scenarios, architecture
2. **Stage 2: Planning** - Extract domain concepts, choose driver type, outline isolation. If an Acceptance Test Strategy Roadmap exists, review it; otherwise ask whether to generate one before entering Phase 1.
3. **Stage 3: Three-Phase Cycle** - Phase 1 → 2 → 3 with review after each
4. **Stage 4: Complete** - Repeat or confirm done

## Required Infrastructure

Before starting Phase 1, verify these exist (check context/codebase):

**Core Utilities:**

- `DslContext` class: manages aliasing/sequences for test isolation
- `Params` helper class: extracts parameters with `.alias()` and `.optional()` methods

**DSL Structure:**

- Domain-specific DSL classes (e.g., `UserDsl`, `TodoDsl`): extracted from BDD domain concepts, depend on `ProtocolDriver` interface
- Main `Dsl` class: composes domain DSL objects (e.g., `dsl.user`, `dsl.todo`), accepts `ProtocolDriver` in constructor

**Protocol Abstraction:**

- `ProtocolDriver` interface: defines contract all drivers implement
- Factory function: `createProtocolDriver(protocol: string)` for runtime driver selection

**If missing:** Ask user to either (1) provide these files/implementations in context, or (2) request you create them. Do NOT proceed to Phase 1 without this infrastructure.

## Three-Phase Test Cycle

Stop for review after every phase. Remember the current phase between messages.

### 🔴 Phase 1 · Executable Spec & DSL (spec must fail)

- Map each BDD line to exactly one DSL call (see transformation example above)
- Use only `// Given`, `// When`, `// Then`, `// And`, `// But` comments in executable specs
- Test file pattern: `let dsl: Dsl` + `beforeEach(() => { dsl = new Dsl(createProtocolDriver(...)) })` - guarantees fresh DSL/context per test
- Test file imports test runner functions (Vitest/Jest: `describe`, `it`, `beforeEach`) - minimal coupling at test file level only
- Test file imports factory: `createProtocolDriver(process.env.ACCEPTANCE_TEST_PROTOCOL || "ui")` for runtime protocol selection
- First action in each test: create account boundary (e.g., `dsl.user.hasAccount({ email: "..." })`)
- DSL methods: use `params.alias()` for identifiers and `params.optional()`/`params.optionalSequence()`/`params.optionalList()` for defaults
- DSL calls driver methods that don't exist yet - compilation failures count as valid RED state per TDD's Three Laws
- Output: failing spec plus DSL layer skeleton → stop for review

### 🟢 Phase 2 · Protocol Driver Implementation

- Implement driver class that implements `ProtocolDriver` interface
- Driver methods match DSL names exactly, ensuring atomic success/failure and polling (no sleeps)
- Stub only external third-party systems (see stubbing rules above)
- All assertions/failures throw standard `Error` (framework-agnostic: works with any test runner)
- Use factory pattern to create drivers: `createProtocolDriver(protocol)` enables runtime protocol selection
- Output: driver implementation complete, tests executable → stop for review (test outcomes depend on SUT readiness)

### 🧼 Phase 3 · Refine & Validate Isolation

- Verify system, functional, and temporal isolation by running specs in parallel and re-running a scenario to confirm deterministic results
- Keep DSL natural language, remove duplication, ensure layer separation
- Output: polished four-layer solution with isolation validated → stop for final review

## Critical Rules

- Always use `params.alias()` for identifiers (emails, usernames, todo names, order IDs) - enables parallel execution and repeatable runs
- Use `params.optional()` for non-essential parameters and `params.optionalSequence()`/`params.optionalList()` when defaults must stay deterministic or ordered
- Each test must create its own domain partition (e.g., unique account) as first step
- DSL names mirror BDD wording exactly (`hasCompletedTodo`, `archives`, `confirmInArchive`)
- DSL is pure translation: NO business logic, NO assertions - just parameter handling, aliasing, and driver delegation
- DSL and drivers are stateless; SUT is the single source of truth - always query SUT for verification
- DSL depends ONLY on `ProtocolDriver` interface, never concrete driver implementations
- Driver methods return `Promise<void>`: resolve on success, throw `Error` on failure (no booleans)
- All Protocol Drivers implement `ProtocolDriver` interface for runtime protocol switching
- Multi-step flows hidden in driver (e.g., `hasAccount` does register + login internally)
- Polling with timeouts for async operations; no arbitrary `sleep()` calls

## Domain Concept Extraction

From BDD scenarios (and Ubiquitous Language glossary if provided), extract domain concepts to partition DSL:

- **Domain entities** → DSL objects: Identify key actors/aggregates (User, Todo, Order) → create `dsl.user`, `dsl.todo`, `dsl.order`
- **Actions on entities** → DSL methods: Verbs from scenarios → `hasCompletedTodo()`, `archives()`, `placeOrder()`
- **Expected outcomes** → Verification methods: Use "confirm" prefix → `confirmInArchive()`, `confirmErrorMessage()`

Partition by domain concern, not by technical layer. Each DSL object represents a distinct domain concept.
