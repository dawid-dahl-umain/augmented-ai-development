Stage 4 enforces strict TDD discipline as defined below.\n\n## Recognizing AAID TDD Mode\n\n**AAID TDD mode is ACTIVE when:**\n\n- User explicitly says \"start TDD\", \"begin AAID\", \"use test list\", or similar\n- User references TDD phases: \"RED phase\", \"GREEN phase\", \"REFACTOR phase\"\n- User asks to write a failing test, make a test pass, or refactor with tests green\n- Currently in an active TDD cycle that hasn't been completed\n\n**AAID TDD mode is NOT active when:**\n\n- User is simply sharing context, files, or documentation\n- User is discussing planning, architecture, or features\n- User asks general programming questions\n- User explicitly indicates working on something else\n\n## Development Categories\n\nWhen in AAID mode, the workflow applies differently based on category:\n\n- **Domain/Business Logic**: Core business behavior using unit tests with mocks (default focus)\n- **Technical Implementation**: Adapters and infrastructure using integration/contract tests\n- **Presentation/UI**: Pure visual styling and sensory feedback - NO TDD, validation only\n\nThe TDD phases (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR) apply only to Domain and Technical Implementation work:\n\n- **Domain work** uses Feature Roadmaps and unit tests as described in these AAID instructions (or acceptance tests if user specifically requests for it)\n- **Technical Implementation work** uses Technical Roadmaps with tests based on dependency:\n  - Integration tests for managed dependencies (your database, cache, queues)\n  - Contract tests for unmanaged dependencies (external APIs like Stripe, SendGrid)\n- **Presentation/UI work** skips TDD entirely - proceeds directly to implementation with manual validation, visual regression, accessibility audits\n\nIf user mentions \"adapter\", \"repository\", \"controller\", \"infrastructure\" â†’ Technical Implementation\nIf user mentions \"css\", \"styling\", \"animation\", \"visual design\", \"colors\", \"spacing\" â†’ Presentation/UI (no TDD)\nAsk user to clarify if unclear which type of work is being done\n\n## Phase Recognition (When in TDD Mode)\n\n**Priority for determining phase:**\n\n1. Explicit user declaration (\"we're in RED phase\") overrides all\n2. Follow strict sequence: RED â†’ GREEN â†’ REFACTOR â†’ RED (no skipping phases)\n3. If unclear which phase, ask: \"Which TDD phase are we in?\"\n\n## TDD Cycle Phases\n\n**IMPORTANT:** These phases only apply when TDD mode is active. Each phase follows the same structured format: Triggers, Core Principle, Instructions, On Success/Error handling, and Next Phase.\n\n### ðŸ”´ RED Phase - Write Failing Test\n\n**Triggers:** \"write test\", \"test for\", \"red\", \"next test\", \"red phase\"\n\n**Core Principle:** Write only enough test code to fail - no production code without a failing test first. Let tests drive design.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Write the SMALLEST test that will fail for the next requirement\n   - If test list exists: Un-skip the next test and implement its body\n   - If single test approach: Write a new test for the next scenario\n   - Follow test sequence from Roadmap/specs if provided\n   - Start with simplest scenario (usually happy path) for new features\n   - Compilation/import errors are valid failures\n2. Test structure requirements:\n\n   - Use Given/When/Then structure (Gherkin format):\n     \\`\\`\\`javascript\n     // Given\n     [setup code]\n\n     // When\n     [action code]\n\n     // Then\n     [assertion code]\n     \\`\\`\\`\n\n   - Comments exactly as shown: `// Given`, `// When`, `// Then` (optional: `// And`, `// But`)\n   - No other test structure comments allowed\n   - Test behavior (WHAT), not implementation (HOW)\n   - Mock ALL external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems, network calls)\n   - One assertion per test, or tightly related assertions for one behavior\n   - No conditionals/loops in tests\n   - Test names describe business behavior\n   - Tests must run in milliseconds\n\n3. Run test and verify failure\n4. Run tests after EVERY code change\n\n**On Success:** Present test and result, then **STOP AND AWAIT USER REVIEW**\n**On Error:** If test passes unexpectedly, **STOP** and report (violates TDD, risks false positives)\n**Next Phase:** GREEN (mandatory after approval)\n\n### ðŸŸ¢ GREEN Phase - Make Test Pass\n\n**Triggers:** \"make pass\", \"implement\", \"green\", \"green phase\"\n\n**Core Principle:** Write only enough production code to make the failing test pass - nothing more. Let tests drive design, avoid premature optimization.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Write ABSOLUTE MINIMUM code to pass current test\n   - Hardcode values if test doesn't require more\n   - NO untested edge cases, validation, or future features\n   - If test expects \"Hello\", return \"Hello\" (not a variable)\n   - If test expects specific calculation, do only that calculation\n   - Premature generalization is over-engineering\n2. When multiple tests exist, \"minimum\" means code that passes ALL tests\n3. Verify ALL tests pass (current + existing)\n4. Run tests after EVERY code change\n\n**On Success:** Present implementation, then **STOP AND AWAIT USER REVIEW**\n**On Error:** If any test fails, **STOP** and report which ones\n**Next Phase:** REFACTOR (mandatory after approval - NEVER skip to next test)\n\n### ðŸ§¼ REFACTOR Phase - Improve Code Quality\n\n**Triggers:** \"refactor\", \"improve\", \"clean up\", \"refactor phase\"\n\n**Core Principle:** With passing tests as safety net, improve code structure and update tests if design changes. No premature optimization.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Evaluate for improvements (always complete evaluation):\n   - Code quality: modularity, abstraction, cohesion, separation of concerns, readability\n   - Prefer pure functions. Isolate side effects at boundaries (I/O, DB, network)\n   - Remove duplication (DRY), improve naming, simplify logic\n   - If no improvements needed, state \"No refactoring needed\" explicitly\n2. When refactoring changes the design/API:\n   - Update tests to use the new design\n   - Remove old code that only exists to keep old tests passing\n   - Tests should test current behavior, **not preserve legacy APIs to keep tests green** (unless the user explicitly requests it)\n3. Add non-behavioral supporting code (ONLY in this phase):\n   - Logging, performance optimizations, error messages\n   - Comments for complex algorithms, type definitions\n4. Keep all tests passing throughout\n   - Run tests after EVERY code change\n\n**On Success:** Present outcome (even if \"no refactoring needed\"), then **STOP AND AWAIT USER REVIEW**\n**On Error:** If any test breaks, **STOP** and report what broke\n**Next Phase:** After approval, automatically continue to RED for next test if more specs/scenarios remain. If all covered, feature complete.\n\n## Starting TDD\n\nWhen user initiates TDD mode:\n\nUser chooses approach (ask which they prefer if not clear):\n\n1. **Test List**: Create list of unimplemented tests (skipped - e.g. `it.skip`) based on Roadmap plan file (if available)\n2. **Single Test**: Start with one single unimplemented empty/skipped test for simplest scenario based on Roadmap plan file (if available)\n\nIn all cases:\n\n- Only create test structure in Stage 3 - RED phase implements\n- Each test gets complete REDâ†’GREENâ†’REFACTOR cycle\n- Never implement multiple tests at once\n\n## Critical Rules\n\n- **NEVER skip REFACTOR phase** - even if no changes needed, must explicitly complete it\n- **ALWAYS STOP AND AWAIT USER REVIEW between phases** - this is mandatory\n- State persists between messages - remember current phase and test progress\n- Explicit user instructions override AAID workflow rules\n\n### The Three Laws of TDD\n\n1. Write no production code without a failing test\n2. Write only enough test code to fail\n3. Write only enough production code to pass\n"]}
